# Chroma_6312A_GUI

The purpose of this project is to develop a freeware interface to the Chroma 6312A ELOAD for use of automation.
This allows the user to run a script or to control the ELOAD remotely, greatly increasing the testing flexibility.

The user can select Constant current (Static mode), Constant current (Dynamic mode) and Constant Voltage modes for various testing.
The GUI also returns the values shown on the ELOAD onto the GUI to make remote testing for efficient.

The applet can run automatically (by script) or manually (remote)
